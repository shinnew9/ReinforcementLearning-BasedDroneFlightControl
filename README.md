This repository contains an implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for autonomous navigation in a corridor environment with a quadcopter. There are blocks having circular opening for the drone to go through for each 4 meters. The expectation is that the agent navigates through these openings without colliding with blocks. This project currently runs only on Windows since Unreal environments were packaged for Windows.
